# Evolution Project
Evolution simulation written in Python3
## Description
The project reflects the simplest evolutionary processes and predator-prey relations. In our implementation, there are two species: the first one receives energy from sunlight during photosynthesis, and the second one hunts for the first. There are certain rules by which organisms are guided: if the energy level is lower than a specific number, an organism stops moving to receive some energy or dies if it is lower than zero, otherwise, it is constantly moving (up, right, left or right). The direction is embedded in the genome during the organism's creation, as well as its initial position, the position of the closest enemy, initial energy level, and numbers that determine in which direction the creature will tend to move. At the end of a life cycle, organisms leave offspring, from 0 to 4. Mutations also play an important role in population development, we set a certain probability of genome mutation. Thus the genome becomes more diverse and adds more opportunities for survival.
